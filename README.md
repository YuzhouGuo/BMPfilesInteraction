# BMPfilesInteraction
### Work with binary files, read and understand a simple file- format specification and write C code to interact with binary data. Experience with visual image data.

Basically what we are doing here are two tasks: 
 * Have a Mario picture in our hand, and put a black mask on his face by writing codes to interact with bmp files.
 * Have pieces of the Montreal metro map, and puzzle them back to a full map by writing codes to interact with bmp files.
 * All images provided and producted are in the *"bmp" directory*.
 * See the pdf file to have a brief idea about this assignment.
